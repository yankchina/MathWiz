# MathWiz: Programming Mathematical Solutions with Python and Swift

## General Description

The "MathWiz" project is designed to introduce primary and secondary school students to the exciting world of programming and mathematics. Through this 12-week program, students will learn the basics of Python and Swift programming languages, focusing on how these skills can be applied to solve various mathematical problems.

The course begins with an introduction to fundamental programming concepts, easing students into the world of coding. As they progress, they will explore different mathematical concepts, from basic arithmetic to more complex algebraic and geometric problems. The unique aspect of this program is its dual-language approach, allowing students to compare and contrast Python and Swift's applications in solving the same mathematical problems.

In the latter part of the course, students will embark on a journey of creating their own mini-projects, applying what they've learned to real-world mathematical scenarios. This project-based approach not only solidifies their understanding but also encourages creativity and problem-solving skills.

By the end of the course, students will have a foundational understanding of programming in Python and Swift, and how these skills can be applied to mathematical problem-solving, setting them up for future success in STEM fields.
